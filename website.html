            <p>A Structural engineering wonder reminiscent of the prowess of the architects of 8th century India, the Kailasa Temple is part of the rock-hewn monastic cave temple complex, the world-famous, Ellora Caves. This massive Temple structure is believed to have been carved out of a single rock! The Kailasa Temple is an ideal example of Reverse Engineering and was chiseled using the top-down approach in construction. It is believed that three giant trenches were bored into a rock face and almost 2,00,000tonnes of rock would have been excavated to make the temple. It is the Kailasa Temple that houses the world’s largest cantilevered rock ceiling! The temple’s intricate sculptural design adds another flavor to its astounding complexity making it nothing short of an engineering marvel of ancient Indian Architecture.</p>
